## Model Development

**Training** (model trained, validated, tested on non-encrypted data)

*   Run training or test: `ðŸ“„ cloud/traintest_only/launch_train_test_clear.py`

*   Data: !\[alt text\]([https://github.com/vrona/FHE.Chess/blob/quant\_fhe/cloud/data/wb\_2000.ipynb](https://github.com/vrona/FHE.Chess/blob/quant_fhe/cloud/data/wb_2000.ipynb))

*   Models: `ðŸ“„ cloud/model_src/clear`

    *   Source (model 1): `ðŸ“„ cloud/model_src/clear/cnn_source_clear.py`

    *   Target (model 2): `ðŸ“„ cloud/model_src/clear/cnn_target_clear.py`

*   Train, validation, test: `ðŸ“„ cloud/traintest_only`

    *   Source (model 1):

    *   Target (model 2):

*   **Quantization** (model is converted into an integer equivalent)

*   **Simulation** (Virtual Library)

*   **Compilation** (model compiled with Concrete's FHE compiler)

## Model Deployment

*   client generates private keys and a public evaluation key (used by the model's FHE evaluation on the server) and then encrypts data and decrypts results.

*   server runs compiled model, makes inference on encrypted data.
