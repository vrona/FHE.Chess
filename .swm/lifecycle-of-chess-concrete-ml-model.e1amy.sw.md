## Model Development

1.  **Training** (model trained, validated, tested on non-encrypted data)`ðŸ“„ code_src/model_src/clear`

2.  **Quantization** (model is converted into an integer equivalent)

3.  **Simulation** (Virtual Library)

4.  **Compilation** (model compiled with Concrete's FHE compiler)

## Model Deployment

*   client generates private keys and a public evaluation key (used by the model's FHE evaluation on the server) and then encrypts data and decrypts results.

*   server runs compiled model, makes inference on encrypted data.
