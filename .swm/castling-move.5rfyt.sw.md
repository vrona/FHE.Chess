Chess rules: one time possibility that two pieces move at once and over another piece (basically only knights can).

At _Kingside_, the King moves two squares to the right while the right Rook moves two squares over the King.

At _Queenside_, the King moves two squares to the left while the right Rook moves three squares over the King. (prerequisites: no pieces must be between the King and the chosen Rook and none of them have moved yet).
