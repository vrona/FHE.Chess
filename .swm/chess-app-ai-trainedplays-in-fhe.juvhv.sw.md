#Purpose / Context

An application that plays Chess against an AI oponent. The moves are encrypted with FHE so that the AI doesn't see them but can still run its algorithm on them.

A client / server application that enables playing chess with a trained ML model and its corresponding (ZAMA's) Concrete-ML inference implementation.
